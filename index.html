        Hey! My name is Jonathan Miller, and currently I am a freshman at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. I began programming my senior year of high school in AP Computer Science. This class taught me the core fundamentals of python and how these fundamentals could be applied to any other language. With this knowledge I decided to work on projects outside of class, thrilled by what I could create just with a simple line of code. I created Flutter apps, Unity games and even a bank system. Throughout these projects and many others, I've learned a lot about object oriented programming and data structures and algorithms. I have big goals as I continue to grow as a Computer Science student, and I'm excited to see what's next.
